f:T4f0,The sentence came after a discussion related to Hilbert's tenth problem (10th on the list of unsolved problem's from him), the problem is to determin whether it is possible to find a systematic procedure (algorithm) for solving Diophantine equation.
This specific mathemtical problem does not matter for the current discussion, but rather that also Alan Turing and others encountered the same concept from computing prespective. They were asking the question wethere there is a general way to determin if a sequence of strings writtern in a programming language L will halt or run forever for an input I (To determin program P will halt or run forever for an input I). Turns out it is proven that there could not exist such systematic procedure (Algorithm) to do this. Further in the book it explains that this means we can not determin only through systematic procedures the truth or falsity of a mathemtical statement (and also that it is not only the case for the very non practical class of problems) because these statements can be encoded as halting problems and therefore we need still to use creativity and ingenuity to solve them as we can not guarantee that our truth checking program will halt no matter how much time and computing power we throw at it.6:["$","article",null,{"className":"prose lg:prose-xl mx-auto p-6","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl font-bold","children":"Agentic AI and the Place for Human Ingenuity"}],["$","time",null,{"className":"text-gray-500","children":"2026-02-22"}]]}],[["$","p","p-0",{"children":"Recently I came across a note on the place of human creativity and ingenuity in mathematics that was written before the LLMs and agentic AI's popularity.

In these examples we already see that the human judgement as long as the human stays in the loop of the operations is the measure of the \"right answer\" or satisfactory answer, be it usage of the agents to create a web application or answering a normativ question about who is the good guy in a certain group picture (a trend on twitter where users kept asking Grok to remove or keep the best person, most moral, etc in photos of multiple people)."}]
